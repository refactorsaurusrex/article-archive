## Nick's Article Archive

Some articles on the web are too good to risk losing. I created this repo to save copies of articles that I find myself referring back to over and over again. That way, if they should ever go offline, my copy will be safe and sound. Sure, I could use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) or the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), but, meh, I like this solution better. :)
